## Purpose:
Data which can be called as the new world currency, is everywhere, such as on product labels, in an organization’s reports, and in different equipment (sensors, controllers, etc.). Hence, it can be difficult to present data in an appropriate way. Especially so when it concerns complex data formats. Hence, the best way to represent the data is using the charts, graphs, diagrams, data grids, and other tools which is what a dashboard has.
